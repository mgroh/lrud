# Grid

This example shows how to build a grid.

### Running the Example

- Clone this repository
- Navigate into this directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

The example will be running at `localhost:3000`.

### Features Demonstrated

- The `isGrid` prop, which specifies that a node is a grid
- The `defaultFocusColumn` and `defaultFocusRow` props to configure the node that receives focus by default
- The `isActive` class name. Press Enter on your keyboard in the grid to make a node active. In this example, active nodes
  are styled differently than focused ones.
