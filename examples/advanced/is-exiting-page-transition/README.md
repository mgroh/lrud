# `isExiting` Page Transition

This example demonstrates a very specific kind of animated page transition: when the page
transitions _without_ the user selecting a UI element.

This can occur when there are pages that auto-transition after a period of time.

**Heads up!** This example is not interactive (you don't click to switch pages). Instead,
the pages automatically transition every 3 seconds.

### Running the Example

- Clone this repository
- Navigate into this directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

The example will be running at `localhost:3000`.

### Features Demonstrated

- Using the `isExiting` prop to support animated transitions, even without user
  interaction
