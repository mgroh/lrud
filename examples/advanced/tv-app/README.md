# TV App (WIP)

This example shows how you can use this library to build a TV app. Keep in mind
that there are an infinite number of ways that you can architect any given app.
I don't think this is the best possible architecture, nor do I think that you
should necessarily copy this code.

This example exists primarily to serve as a reference of the LRUD library API.

### Running the Example

- Clone this repository
- Navigate into this directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

The example will be running at `localhost:3000`.
